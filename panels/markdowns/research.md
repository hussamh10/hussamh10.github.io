# Research background and interests
I am a computer scientist using computational methods to investigate the role of socio-technical systems in our society. I am curious about the societal issues that emerge through technological advancement, yet I remain optimistic about the potential for change and improvement using these same tools.

Most of my research is guided by a personal curiosity to understand human and machine behavior, coupled with a responsibility to mitigate harms, improve lives, and hold violators accountable.
